# Project 24 - Water Quality Monitoring 
## Description -
Monitor the Quality of water, interns of monitoring the level of water, the temperature of the water and its surrounding, the turbidity of the water (how clean the water is) as well as the PH levels of the Water. So this system monitors all of these aspect and finally when all check have been completed, its sends the information or data as an SMS to notify the authorized personnel.
## Materials -
Arduino Mega Board, (16 * 2) LCD display, The 2 in one Temperature and PH sensor, The Turrbidity Sensor, A GSM shield, An ultrasonic Sensor, 4 RGB led, A buzzer.
### What I Learnt?
Getting to know pH sensors and turbidity sensor, also connecting to network to contact the mobile.
