## Description - 
This lamp has an ultrasonic sensor on the top which is continuously measuring the distance. The measured data is sent to the micro-controller which decided with the distance which actions should run: Turn on, turn off or modify the brightness of the light. ESP8266 runs a web server. This web server, allows you to modify the Wi-Fi connection data without modifying the firmware and most importantly, allows you to set different light colors.
## Materials -
ESP12-F + bread board adapter,WS2812 8x8 LED Matrix, Step-Down Converter, HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, 5V 3A DC adapter, DC power Jack socket
### what I Learnt?
Importance of step down converter, Utilising ultrasonic sensors as PWM and also usage of online colour control.
