# Project 2 - PID based line following bot 

## Description-
A bot with 2 mtors on left and right side which follows a line sensed by QTR sensor. The errors are used wrt PID controller and the volocities of each wheel are given. The sensor pins are in analog 0-5 of the arduino.

## Components-
N20 Micro Metal Geared Motor 12V 300 RPM, QTR sensor , Arduino Uno

### What I Learnt?
About PID and its uses wrt error calculations, QTR sensor specifics
