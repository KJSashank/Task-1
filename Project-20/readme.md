# Project 20 - Fingertap Sounds 
## Desciption -
The project uses a total of four sensor, that is two flex sensor and two Darlington pairs acting as a touch sensor. We have also used two pull down resistors R1 and R2 of value 10k each, which will act as a pull down resistor for the Flex sensor. Here Flex sensor is used to generate Three different tones by using one finger, based on how much it has bent.
