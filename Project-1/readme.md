## Materials - 
Arduino Nano,touch button, resistance (5K ohm, 200 ohm), 5V laser emitter, dual control switch, OLED 0.96 "screen, GY-906 temperature MLX90614 sensor, 9V battery

## Description -
We use 3d printed parts to build a physical gun kind thermometer, which gives the surface temperature of the object in front of it without any physical contact and with an approx error of 0.5 degree C. We connect the circuit as shown in the figure the led is not mandatory, and the code is uploaded below. This can be used after installing the Adafruits SSD1306 and Adafruits MLX90614 libraries for Arduino IDE.
