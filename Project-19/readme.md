# Project 19 - Talking Smart Glass for the Blind
## Description - 
This project uses a few ultrasonic distance sensors, an Arduino Pro Mini, an MP3 player module, and some vibration motors. The circuit board used in this project is designed in the form of a spectacle, which can be worn by a visually impaired person. An Arduino mounted on the spectacle will detect the obstacle with the help of the sensors and notify the user through headphones and vibration motors.
## Materials -
Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04 (Generic), DFRobot DF Player mini, SparkFun Arduino Pro Mini 328 - 5V/16MHz, 3.5mm Audio jack, Vibration motor
### What I learnt?
Usage of DF player mini and software serial, and arduino coding related to it.
