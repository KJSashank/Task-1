# Project 13 - Secret Knock Detecting Door Lock
## Description -
A mechanism that unlocks/locks my door from the inside after receiving a secret combination from the outside. This project uses an arduino Uno, a piezo sensor, and a servo motor. If a piezo sensor hears the right number of knocks in the right cadence it triggers the servo motor to turn lock/unlock the door.
## Materials - 
9v Battery, Jumper Wires, Micro Servo 9g, 9v Battery Clip Connector, Mini Breadboard, 1 Mega Ohm Resistor, Piezo Sensor
### What I Learnt?
Different functions in arduino to sense times and knock percentages. Workings of Piezzo sensor
