# Project 5 - Geasture contolled Robo car
## Description-
Making a Geasture controlled car using PAJ7620 Gesture Sensor with arduino uno and HC-12 wireless module which works as the transmitter. Use another HC-12 with arduino nano working as the reciever to control the motors. Here the arduinos works as the encoder and decoder, where as HC-12 as transmitter and reciver, the sensor is input and the bot is output.
## Materials -
Robot Chassis, HC12, arduino uno, arduino nano, PAJ7620 Gesture Sensor
