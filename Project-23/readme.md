# Project 23 - Air Quality Check
## Description -
IoT device to get the reading of this air monitor on my mobile anywhere in the world and to get notifications when gas levels exceed a certain limit and warn me about a potential gas leak or high CO level. Also ESP8266- ESP 01 is used to make the wifi connection to blynk server which sends notifications to mobile.
## Materials-
Arduino Nano R3,DFRobot Gravity: Analog LPG Gas Sensor (MQ5) For Arduino, DFRobot Carbon Monoxide Sensor (MQ7), DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor (3 pins), Buzzer, Siren Transducer, 12VDC, Espressif ESP8266 ESP-01, Jumper wires (generic), Adafruit Standard LCD - 16x2 White on Blue
### What I Learnt?
Usage of ESP-01 for Wifi connecting, usage of MQ5 & MQ7 sensors, making pictures in LCD display.
